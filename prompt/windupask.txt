The Windup framework is an open-source software analysis and migration tool that helps developers migrate Java applications cross different platform. The framework consists of several components, including a rules engine, a report generator, and a command-line interface. The rules engine is a key component of the Windup framework, as it analyzes Java code to identify potential issues and provides recommendations for resolving them.
The Windup rules for Java migration are a set of pre-defined rules that are used by the rules engine to analyze Java code. These rules cover a wide range of potential issues that can arise during Java migration
